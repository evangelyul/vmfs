# Claude Code Prompt for Flight Sim

Copy and paste this to Claude Code with godot-mcp enabled:

Create a Godot 4 flight simulator project. Reference these files for specifications:
- flight_model_spec.md (aircraft physics parameters)
- project_requirements.md (project structure and features)

Build in this order:

1. Create the project structure with folders: scenes/, scripts/, assets/

2. Create aircraft.gd with:
   - CharacterBody3D flight model
   - Lift/drag/thrust/weight forces
   - Control inputs (pitch, roll, yaw, throttle)
   - Stall modeling
   - State variables (airspeed, altitude, aoa, etc.)

3. Create aircraft.tscn with CharacterBody3D, CollisionShape3D, placeholder MeshInstance3D (BoxMesh)

4. Create fdr_output.gd that sends UDP packets on port 49003 in X-Plane DATA format (groups 3, 4, 17, 20)

5. Create hud.gd and hud.tscn with Control node showing: airspeed, altitude, vvi, heading, throttle as Labels

6. Create main.tscn with:
   - WorldEnvironment + DirectionalLight3D
   - Ground plane (StaticBody3D + MeshInstance3D + CollisionShape3D)
   - Aircraft instance at position (0, 300, 0)
   - HUD instance
   
7. Set up input actions in project.godot for: pitch_up, pitch_down, roll_left, roll_right, yaw_left, yaw_right, throttle_up, throttle_down

8. Run the project and verify:
   - Aircraft responds to controls
   - HUD updates
   - UDP packets are being sent

Fix any errors and iterate until flyable.
